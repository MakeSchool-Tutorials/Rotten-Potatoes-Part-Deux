So you went live with your new startup **Rotten Potatoes**, and right away you got feedback from your users. They want reviews to be organized and reliably grouped by movie. They also want to see the movie's trailer.

Besides these requests, you have a few things you think should happen too...

# Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes you have already _completed_ the [first Rotten Potatoes tutorial](https://www.makeschool.com/academy/track/rotten-potatoes---movie-reviews-with-express-js). Please do so before starting here with Part Deux.

# User Stories (For Now)

At the beginning of any project, we always want to make a plan. And that plan comes in the form of **User Stories**.

Some of these user stories will require major refactoring of our app.

For now, here are the user stories you could write to encapsulate the feedback you are getting from your users.

1. User can see recent movies from TheMovieDB
1. User can see one Movie, including the poster and trailer
1. User reviews are associated with one movie
1. Add 100% test coverage for all routes
