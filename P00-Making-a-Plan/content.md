So you went live with your new startup **Rotten Potatoes**, and right away you got feedback from your users. They want reviews to be organized and reliably grouped by movie. They also want to see the movie's trailer.

Besides these requests, you have a few things you think should happen too...

# Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes you have already _completed_ the [first Rotten Potatoes tutorial](https://www.makeschool.com/academy/track/rotten-potatoes---movie-reviews-with-express-js). Please do so before starting here with Part Deux.

# Learning Outcomes

By the end of this tutorial, you should be able to...

1. Use a GitHub Feature Branch strategy to refactor a project
1. Integrate an external API to add a new resource
1. Outline how to rewire existing routes into nested routes
1. Use `AJAX` requests via `Axios` to do POST and DELETE actions to the server
1. Create client-side scripts using JavaScript

# User Stories

At the beginning of any project, we always want to make a plan. And that plan comes in the form of **User Stories**.

Some of these user stories will require major refactoring of our app.

For now, here are the user stories you could write to encapsulate the feedback you are getting from your users.

1. Users can see recent movies from TheMovieDB
1. Users can see one Movie, including the poster and trailer
1. Users reviews are associated with the corresponding movie
1. Users can add or delete comments without requiring a page refresh
1. Users can access an admin dashboard that lists all reviews and allows them to delete them

# "Gitting" Started

You should already have a repository from the first Rotten Potatoes tutorial. We'll continue to work out of that one, so no need to set up anything new!
